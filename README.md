Hello,
My name is Malak Mehrez, and I am an AUB Alumni with a bachelor of science
in computer science.
My interest lies in software engineering, particularly Mobile Development and here i am android developer intern at Codsoft where i have the chance to showcase my abilities and various skills through the tasks i am doing during the 4-week virtual internship.

and one can notice the former in the application i build through the internship, where i focus on varying my style of developing the application from folder structure and code organization to using diverse tool and design patterns.

I am working on improving the skills i am intrested in including building a cross-platform application and focusing on the experience and UI of the android user using flutter framework for the frontend and firebase: authentication and real-time database for the backend. That's it for the Wisdom Wave (Quiz App) and WordAlChemy (quote App)

Demo:
